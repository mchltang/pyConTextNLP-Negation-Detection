Common noted errors:
- "ill" often misdetected as substring in words like "chill"
- phrases like "nontender" not detected as negated concepts
- Sentencizer has problems with these kinds of transcripts and therefore many false positives
- (trauma)tic happens sometimes because targets do not have leading or ending spaces required in the regex
- "obs" and "ld" for pregnancy are often misdetected in "observations", also for "obstruction" and "old"
- loss of consciousness (loc) sometimes detected in "location"
- "clear breath sounds" -> negated concept "wheezing" detected, which is technically true! But in the sense that the program meant it, it's not true. RIP
- "N&V" for nausea and vomiting wasn't in the target file so it wasn't detected
- "c/p" for chest pain not in target file
- "n/v/d" is only in diarrhea so nausea and vomiting aren't detected
- in these transcripts, the "-" symbol is used to represent negation a lot of the times, which is uncharacteristic of spoken dialogue.

Possible improvements:
- maybe try ignoring any detections that span more than 100 characters in length? that would definitely boost precision
